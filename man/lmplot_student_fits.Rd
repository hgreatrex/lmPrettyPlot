\title{Studentized Residual Plot for Linear Regression Model Output}
\usage{
lmplot_student_fits(mymodel)
}
\arguments{
\item{mymodel}{A fitted linear model (`lm` object).}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object showing studentized residuals plotted against predicted values.
The plot visually indicates whether residuals are randomly scattered (suggesting a good fit)
or show systematic patterns (indicating potential issues with model assumptions).
}
\description{
Generates a studentized residual plot to assess the assumptions of a linear model.
}
\details{
This function creates a residual plot for a fitted linear model, highlighting studentized residuals.
The plot includes reference bands at ±2 and ±3 standard deviations, a smoothed LOESS curve,
and predicted vs residual points to help visualize potential issues with linearity or heteroscedasticity.

# Example 1: Using the built-in mtcars dataset
data(mtcars)
model_mtcars <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

# Example 2: Using the diamonds dataset from the yarrr package (if available)
if (requireNamespace("yarrr", quietly = TRUE)) {

  model_diamonds <- lm(value ~ weight, data = diamonds)
  lmplot_student_fits(model_diamonds)
} else {
